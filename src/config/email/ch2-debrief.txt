Sparrow,

You found her. And then you found another.

Mrs. Potter Palmer was no mere socialite. When the World's Columbian Exposition came to Chicago in 1893, she was appointed President of the Board of Lady Managers — the highest position a woman held at the Fair. She used that authority to champion artists the establishment had overlooked, acquiring works that would later anchor the collections of the very institution you walked through today.

But Palmer did not collect alone. Her closest advisor was a painter living abroad — an American woman whose quiet domestic scenes concealed a radical eye. You stood before her work. The same year. 1893. The same room. Two visions, one purpose.

That painter saw what others could not. The Order valued her sight above almost all others.

And then the world took her eyes. By 1914 she could no longer hold a brush. She spent her final twelve years in darkness — just as the timekeeper of the Manor lost his sight before her.

Do you see the pattern, Sparrow? The sight is taken from those who see too much.

The painter's legacy did not end in that gallery. Her vision endures in a place you may one day visit — a museum built into the hills of a distant state, where art and nature converge. A modern patron built it, one who saw what Palmer saw a century before her.

But that is a story for another time.

Your second fragment has been placed in the vault. The Council has taken notice.
