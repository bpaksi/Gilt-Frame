Sparrow,

You found her. The Order is pleased.

Mrs. Potter Palmer was no mere socialite. When the World's Columbian Exposition came to Chicago in 1893, she was appointed President of the Board of Lady Managers, the highest position a woman held at the Fair. She used that authority to champion artists the establishment had overlooked, purchasing works that would later anchor the collections of the very institution you walked through today.

Among those she championed was a woman painter living abroad, one whose quiet domestic scenes concealed a radical eye. Palmer acquired her work when few collectors would. That painter's legacy now resides in a place you may one day visit, a museum built into the hills of a distant state, where art and nature converge.

But that is a story for another time.

Your second fragment has been placed in the vault. The Council has taken notice.
