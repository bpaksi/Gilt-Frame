Sparrow,

The sundial at the manor held more than time. You found what it concealed, but have you considered where it pointed?

A compass does not forget its bearing. Neither should you.

The Order does not summon without purpose. When the next call comes, you will understand why the needle chose its direction.

Until then, patience. The worthy do not rush toward what is already in motion.
