Sparrow,

The Order does not summon without reason. You have spoken the words. The Sight stirs. But a word spoken is not a trial endured.

The Keeper of the Western Shore built his station on the highest ground he could find, not for vanity, but for the sightlines it commanded. He sheltered every bird that came to his land. The man who fed the world also fed the sparrows. Consider that, young bird.

He was one of ours. The Order does not say this lightly. For decades, the Keeper maintained the fragments between the lake and the city beyond the horizon. His eyes held the Sight longer than most. When they could not make him look away, they took his eyes. When that was not enough, they took the rest.

His grounds still mark what he left behind. Someone must carry his work forward.

The Order has prepared instruments to aid in your journey.

The Journey is your Chronicle, a record of every step taken, every fragment earned. The Order keeps its own records. This one is yours.

The Oracle connects you to the Council of Whispers. Through it, you may ask what you wish to know. Who was the Keeper? Why was his station built on the highest ground? What is the Sight, and why must it be protected? The Council will answer, though not always as directly as you might hope. They have guarded these truths for a long time. They will not surrender them to impatience.

Prepare yourself. The timekeeper awaits.
