Sparrow,

The Council has convened. What you found at the Manor has changed our understanding of the western sightline.

For decades, the timekeeper stood silent. The Order knew the Manor held significance — the windmill, the sightlines, the convergence at the water — but the bearing had never been confirmed. We theorized. We waited. We could not activate what we did not fully understand.

You did.

The man who built that Manor was called W.K. Kellogg. He was not a member of the Order, but he was known to us. He built on land the Order had marked long before his time, and whether he understood what lay beneath his gardens or merely felt its pull, the result was the same: he maintained the sightlines. The sundial. The windmill's axis. The geometry of the grounds. He preserved what needed preserving, even if he never knew why.

In the final years of his life, his sight was taken from him.

The Order does not believe this was chance. We have seen it before — those who guard the sightlines losing the very faculty the Order values most. It is a pattern we do not yet fully understand, and one we do not speak of lightly. But you should know: the path you walk is not unopposed. There are forces that prefer the frames to remain dark.

The bearing you confirmed — 255 degrees west-southwest — points to Chicago. Specifically, it points to a gallery where a portrait has hung for more than a century. The woman in that portrait shaped the Order during the age of the great Fair. She was called many things: patroness, empress, queen without a crown. Her name, and the name of the painter who captured her, will be revealed when you stand before her.

The timekeeper spoke through you, Sparrow. The Council is grateful. And watchful.

A summons will follow by post. When it arrives, you will know the next trial is near.
