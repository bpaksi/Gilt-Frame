Sparrow,

You have been summoned to the palace of art beside the lake. The Order placed you here for a reason, though you may not yet understand why.

In 1893, the White City rose from the marshlands of this very shore. A great Fair drew the world to Chicago, and with it came a woman whose eye for beauty would reshape what this nation collected, celebrated, and preserved. She moved among artists and diplomats alike, and she understood something few of her contemporaries grasped: that art is not decoration, it is power.

A painter from across the sea was commissioned to capture her likeness. He saw what the camera could not, the bearing of someone who bends the world by force of vision alone. That portrait endures within these walls.

Your trial: find her.

You have already been told the gallery. Enter it. Study the faces that line those walls. When you believe you have found her, the Order will test your certainty.

Two questions will be asked of you. They concern what she holds and what she wears. Look closely. The answer is in the paint.

Do not rush. The Order rewards patience and precision, not speed.
