The Order communicates through Markers — symbols placed in the world for those with eyes to see. A single point crowns the Marker: life in motion, singular and fleeting. Beneath it rest three points: death and the eternal, patient and immovable. The meaning is plain to those who dare to read it — live every day to the fullest, for the flame above is brief and the darkness below is forever. When you find a Marker, you have found a reminder. Not of what awaits you, but of what you must not waste.
