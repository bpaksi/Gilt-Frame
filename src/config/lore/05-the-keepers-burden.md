Not all who serve the Order do so with brush or chisel. Some are Keepers — those who preserve what the world would let decay. The Keeper of Gull Lake was a man of extraordinary vision who built beauty on the water's edge. His sight was taken from him — quietly, in a way the world would call natural. He did not stop. He continued his work in darkness, guarding what he could no longer see. And then he was gone. The Order does not speak of how. Only that those who see most deeply are the first to draw attention, and that attention has a price.
