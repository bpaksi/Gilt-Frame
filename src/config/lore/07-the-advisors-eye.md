Behind every great patron stands an eye that sees differently. The Advisor was a painter who left her homeland to study light in a foreign city. She taught the Patron where to look and what to hide. In her greatest work, she painted the world from above — as a bird might see it. The Order recognized the perspective of one who truly sees. In time, her sight was taken — quietly, as it was with the Keeper. She did not stop. She kept painting in near-blindness, kept seeing what others could not. And then she, too, was gone. The pattern holds: those who refuse to stop seeing pay the highest price.
