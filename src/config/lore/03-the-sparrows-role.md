In the Order's hierarchy, the Sparrow is the protector — the one who walks where others will not, carrying what others cannot. The Sparrow is not chosen by blood or rank, but by the depth of their seeing. To be named Sparrow is to bear a weight the Order itself will not carry. The Sparrow goes forth into the world to recover what has been lost and to guard what remains. It is the highest honor the Order bestows. Whether it is also the highest cost, the Order does not say.
