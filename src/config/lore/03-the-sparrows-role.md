In the Order's hierarchy, the Sparrow is the seeker — the one who moves between worlds, carrying fragments of truth from one trial to the next. The Sparrow is not chosen by blood or rank, but by the quality of their seeing. To be named Sparrow is to be entrusted with the Order's most sacred task: to prove that beauty endures.
